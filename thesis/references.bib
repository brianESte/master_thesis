	            in the realm of public railroad transport on wide-area networks.
	            Such a system has to process a large number of on-line queries

	abstract = {A* is a search algorithm that has long been used in the
	            pathfinding research community. Its efficiency, simplicity, and
	            modularity are often highlighted as its strengths compared to
	            other tools. Due to its ubiquity and widespread usage, A* has
	            become a common option for researchers attempting to solve
	            pathfinding problems. However, the sheer amount of research done
	            on the topic makes it difficult to know where to start looking.
	            With this paper, we hope to create an accessible, up to date
	            reference on the current state of the A* search algorithm for
	            future pathfinding projects to consider. This paper examines
	            A-Star’s current usage in the field of pathfinding, comparing A*
	            to other search algorithms. It also analyzes potential future
	            developments for A-Star’s development. A* cannot keep up with the
	            demands of current pathfinding problems. Other algorithms can
	            maintain the same performance while also demanding less overhead
	            and this problem only grows worse as grid size increases. However
	            , use of innovative modifications such as different heuristic
	            types or secondary components to the algorithm allow A* to
	            achieve very fast times with good accuracy when dealing with
	            large maps, while only having slightly increased overhead costs
	            for the modifications. While beginning to show its age, improved
	            algorithms based on the classic A* algorithm are more than
	            capable of keeping up with modern pathfinding demands. These
	            derivative search algorithms such as HPA* is used to overcome the
	            limitations of A*. HPA* can compete with and even surpass its
	            competitors depending on the challenge faced.},

	abstract = {Abstract Field operations should be done in a manner that
	            minimizes time and travels over the field surface and is
	            coordinated with topographic land features. Automated path
	            planning can help to find the best coverage path so that the
	            field operation costs can be minimized. Intelligent algorithms
	            are desired for both two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional
	            (3D) terrain field coverage path planning. The algorithm of
	            generating an optimized full coverage pattern for a given 2D
	            planar field by using boustrophedon paths has been investigated
	            and reported before. However, a great proportion of farms have
	            rolling terrains, which have a considerable influence on the
	            design of coverage paths. Coverage path planning in 3D space has
	            a great potential to further optimize field operations. This work
	            addressed four critical tasks: terrain modeling and
	            representation, coverage cost analysis, terrain decomposition,
	            and the development of optimized path searching algorithm. The
	            developed algorithms and methods have been successfully
	            implemented and tested using 3D terrain maps of farm fields with
	            various topographic features. Each field was decomposed into
	            subregions based on its terrain features. A recommended “seed
	            curve” based on a customized cost function was searched for each
	            subregion, and parallel coverage paths were generated by
	            offsetting the found “seed curve” toward its two sides until the
	            whole region was completely covered. Compared with the 2D
	            planning results, the experimental results of 3D coverage path
	            planning showed its superiority in reducing both headland turning
	            cost and soil erosion cost. On the tested fields, on average the
	            3D planning algorithm saved 10.3\% on headland turning cost, 24.7
	            \% on soil erosion cost, 81.2\% on skipped area cost, and 22.0\%
	            on the weighted sum of these costs, where their corresponding
	            weights were 1, 1, and 0.5, respectively. © 2011 Wiley

	            covered and receives an acceptably uniform layer of paint
	            deposition; we call this the “uniform coverage” problem. The
	            uniform coverage problem is challenging because the atomizer
	            emits a non-trivial paint distribution, thus making the
	            relationships between the spray gun trajectory and the deposition
	            uniformity complex. To understand the key issues involved in
	            uniform coverage, we consider surface patches that are
	            geodesically convex and topologically simple as representative of
	            subsets of realistic automotive surfaces. In addition to ensuring
	            uniform paint deposition on the surface, our goal is to also
	            minimize the associated process cycle time and paint waste. Based
	            on the relationships between the spray gun trajectory and the
	            output characteristics (i.e., uniformity, cycle time and paint
	            waste), our approach decomposes the coverage trajectory
	            generation problem into three subproblems: (1) selecting a seed
	            curve, (2) determining a speed profile along each pass, and (3)
	            selecting the spacing between successive passes. Using concepts
	            such as area magnification and the Gauss-Bonnet theorem from
	            differential geometry, as well as standard optimization
	            procedures, we present procedures to solve each subproblem
	            independently from the others. We demonstrate our trajectory
	            planning procedures by approximating real automotive surfaces by
	            simple surfaces in simulation, and finally evaluate the

	            tedious and dangerous tasks. The use of robots bypasses the
	            hazards and potentially increases the efficiency of both tasks. A
	            first crucial step towards robotic mine/UXO clearance is to
	            locate all the targets. This requires a path planner that
	            generates a path to pass a detector over all points of a mine/UXO
	            field, i.e., a planner that is complete.The current state of the
	            art in path planning for mine/UXO clearance is to move a robot
	            randomly or use simple heuristics. These methods do not possess
	            completeness guarantees which are vital for locating all of the
	            mines/UXOs. Using such random approaches is akin to intentionally
	            using imperfect detectors. In this paper, we first overview our
	            prior complete coverage algorithm and compare it with randomized
	            approaches. In addition to the provable guarantees, we
	            demonstrate that complete coverage achieves coverage in shorter
	            time than random coverage. We also show that the use of complete
	            approaches enables the creation of a filter to reject bad sensor
	            readings, which is necessary for successful deployment of robots.
	            We propose a new approach to handle sensor uncertainty that uses
	            geometrical and topological features rather than sensor
	            uncertainty models. We have verified our results by performing
	            experiments in unstructured indoor environments. Finally, for
	            scenarios where some a priori information about a minefield is
	            available, we expedite the demining process by introducing a
	            probabilistic method so that a demining robot does not have to
	            perform exhaustive coverage. },

	            covers every point of a certain area of interest. In recent times
	            , Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have been employed in several
	            application domains involving terrain coverage, such as
	            surveillance, smart farming, photogrammetry, disaster management,
	            civil security, and wildfire tracking, among others. This paper
	            aims to explore and analyze the existing studies in the
	            literature related to the different approaches employed in
	            coverage path planning problems, especially those using UAVs. We
	            address simple geometric flight patterns and more complex
	            grid-based solutions considering full and partial information
	            about the area of interest. The surveyed coverage approaches are
	            classified according to a classical taxonomy, such as no
	            decomposition, exact cellular decomposition, and approximate
	            cellular decomposition. This review also contemplates different
	            shapes of the area of interest, such as rectangular, concave and
	            convex polygons. The performance metrics usually applied to
	            evaluate the success of the coverage missions are also presented.

	            aerial vehicles has dramatically increased in the last years. To
	            fully automatize the surveying missions it is essential to solve
	            the coverage path planning problem defined as the task of
	            computing a path for a robot so that all the points of a region
	            of interest will be observed. State-of-the-art planners define as
	            the optimal path the one with the minimum number of flight lines.
	            However, the connection path, composed by the path from the
	            starting point to the region of interest plus the path from it to
	            the ending point, is underestimated. We propose an efficient
	            planner for computing the optimal edge-vertex back-and-forth
	            path. Unlike previous approaches, we take into account the
	            starting and ending points. In this article, we demonstrate the

	abstract = {The pandemic by COVID-19 is causing a devastating effect on the
	            health of the global population. Currently, there are several
	            efforts to prevent the spread of the virus. Among those efforts,
	            cleaning and disinfecting public areas have become important
	            tasks and they should be automated in future smart cities. To
	            contribute in this direction, this paper proposes a coverage path
	            planning method for a spraying drone, an unmanned aerial vehicle
	            that has mounted a sprayer/sprinkler system, that can disinfect
	            areas. State-of-the-art planners consider a camera instead of a
	            sprinkler, in consequence, the expected coverage will differ in
	            running time because the liquid dispersion is different from a
	            camera’s projection model. In addition, current planners assume
	            that the vehicles can fly outside the target region; this
	            assumption can not be satisfied in our problem, because
	            disinfections are performed at low altitudes. Our method presents
	            i) a new sprayer/sprinkler model that fits a more realistic
	            coverage volume to the drop dispersion and ii) a planning method
	            that efficiently restricts the flight to the region of interest
	            avoiding potential collisions in bounded scenes. The algorithm
	            has been tested in several simulation scenes, showing that it is
	            effective and covers more areas with respect to two approaches in
	            the literature. Note that the proposal is not limited to
	            disinfection applications, but can be applied to other ones, such
	            as painting or precision agriculture.},

	            Differential Evolution variants with Linear population size

	            points. The key idea is establishing the relationship between the

	            suitable for complex areas as well as multi-area. The simulation
	            results with MATLAB showed the improvement of coverage path
	            planning task execution efficiency. Compared with the method

	            the multi-area coverage path length by 4%–7%. From the

	            and optimization of field operations. It can provide the
	            waypoints required for guidance, navigation and control of
	            agricultural robots and autonomous tractors throughout the
	            execution of these field operations. Typical field operations are
	            repetitively required nearly every cropping season and therefore
	            it should be carried out in a manner that maximizes the yield and
	            minimizes operational cost, time and environmental impact taking
	            into account the topographic land features. Current 3D terrain
	            field coverage path planning algorithms are simply 2D coverage
	            path planning projected into 3D through field terrain represented
	            by the field’s Digital Elevation Model (DEM). When projecting 2D
	            coverage plan into its 3D counterpart, the actual distance
	            between adjacent paths on the topographic surface either
	            increases or decreases, and consequently there might be skips or
	            overlaps between adjacent paths on the slopes. In addition, when
	            the machine rolls on slopes the effective width of the implement
	            decreases by a similar amount to double this error and
	            complicates the problem. Skips and overlaps can lead to an
	            inefficient use of land and resources. In this paper, a numerical
	            approach to estimate the total skip/overlap areas is developed
	            and applied to determine the optimum-driving angle that minimizes
	            this impact. Also, a novel side-to-side 3D coverage path planning
	            approach, which ensures zero skips/overlaps regardless of the
	            topographical nature of the field terrain, is developed. The
	            approaches developed in this paper are tested and validated using
	            a hypothetical test field of a tailored terrain and a real

	            high-quality images with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for
	            precise 3D reconstruction has become a prominent topic of study.
	            In this research, we proposed a coverage path planning method for
	            UAVs to achieve full coverage of a target area and to collect
	            high-resolution images while considering the overlap ratio of the
	            collected images and energy consumption of clustered UAVs. The
	            overlap ratio of the collected image set is guaranteed through a
	            map decomposition method, which can ensure that the
	            reconstruction results will not get affected by model breaking.
	            In consideration of the small battery capacity of common
	            commercial quadrotor UAVs, ray-scan-based area division was
	            adopted to segment the target area, and near-optimized paths in
	            subareas were calculated by a simulated annealing algorithm to
	            find near-optimized paths, which can achieve balanced task
	            assignment for UAV formations and minimum energy consumption for
	            each UAV. The proposed system was validated through a site
	            experiment and achieved a reduction in path length of
	            approximately 12.6% compared to the traditional zigzag path.},

	            engineering, urban planning, surveillance and defense research.
	            It is a two level problem, being the former the acquisition of
	            the aerial images and the later, the 3D reconstruction. We focus
	            here in the first problem, known as coverage path planning, and
	            we consider the case where the camera is mounted on an unmanned
	            aerial vehicle (UAV). In contrast with the case when ground
	            vehicles are used, coverage path planning for a UAV is a lesser
	            studied problem. As the areas to cover become complex, there is a
	            clear need for algorithms that will provide good enough solutions
	            in affordable times, while taking into account certain
	            specificities of the problem at hand. Our algorithm can deal with
	            both convex and non-convex areas and their main aim is to obtain
	            a path that reduces the battery consumption, through minimizing
	            the number of turns. We comment on line sweep calculation and
	            propose improvements for the path generation and the polygon
	            decomposition problems such as coverage alternatives and the
	            interrupted path concept. Illustrative examples show the
	            potential of our algorithm in two senses: ability to perform the
	            coverage when complex regions are considered, and achievement of
	            better solution than a published result (in terms of the number
	            of turns used).},

	ABSTRACT = {Path planning is one of the most important issues in the
	            robotics field, being applied in many domains ranging from
	            aerospace technology and military tasks to manufacturing and
	            agriculture. Path planning is a branch of autonomous navigation.
	            In autonomous navigation, dynamic decisions about the path have
	            to be taken while the robot moves towards its goal. Among the
	            navigation area, an important class of problems is Coverage Path
	            Planning (CPP). The CPP technique is associated with determining
	            a collision-free path that passes through all viewpoints in a
	            specific area. This paper presents a method to perform CPP in 3D
	            environment for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) applications,
	            namely 3D dynamic for CPP applications (3DD-CPP). The proposed
	            method can be deployed in an unknown environment through a
	            combination of linear optimization and heuristics. A model to
	            estimate cost matrices accounting for UAV power usage is proposed
	            and evaluated for a few different flight speeds. As linear
	            optimization methods can be computationally demanding to be used
	            on-board a UAV, this work also proposes a distributed execution
	            of the algorithm through fog-edge computing. Results showed that
	            3DD-CPP had a good performance in both local execution and
	            fog-edge for different simulated scenarios. The proposed
	            heuristic is capable of re-optimization, enabling execution in
	            environments with local knowledge of the environments.},

	ABSTRACT = {To cover an area of interest by an autonomous vehicle, such as
	            an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), planning a coverage path which
	            guides the unit to cover the area is an essential process.
	            However, coverage path planning is often problematic, especially
	            when the boundary of the area is complicated and the area
	            contains several obstacles. A common solution for this situation
	            is to decompose the area into disjoint convex sub-polygons and to
	            obtain coverage paths for each sub-polygon using a simple
	            back-and-forth pattern. Aligned with the solution approach, we
	            propose a new convex decomposition method which is simple and
	            applicable to any shape of target area. The proposed method is
	            designed based on the idea that, given an area of interest
	            represented as a polygon, a convex decomposition of the polygon
	            mainly occurs at the points where an interior angle between two
	            edges of the polygon is greater than 180 degrees. The performance
	            of the proposed method is demonstrated by comparison with
	            existing convex decomposition methods using illustrative
	            examples.},

	            applications.The course begins with the core ideas from exterior
	            calculus, in both the smooth and discrete setting. Then it shows

	            (smoothing, parameterization, geodesics, mesh optimization, etc.)
	            can be implemented quickly, robustly, and efficiently within this

	            the Gaussian curvature is unchanged when the surface is bent

	abstract = { K-means and watershed segmentation techniques are presented to
	            perform image segmentation and edge detection tasks. We first
	            used the K-means technique to obtain a primary segmented image.
	            We then employed a watershed technique that works on that image;
	            this process includes gradient of the segmented input image,
	            divides the image into markers, completes the watershed line by
	            using the markers, and stores the image in the format of region
	            adjacency graph (RAG). The initial segmentation result was
	            obtained by the watershed algorithm. We then used merging
	            techniques based on mean gray values and two edge strengths (Ti,
	            T2) to obtain edge maps. In this article we solved the problem of
	            undesirable oversegmentation results produced by the watershed
	            algorithm, when used directly with raw data images. Also, the
	            edge maps have no broken lines on the entire image, and the final
	            edge detection result is one closed boundary per actual region in
	            the image. },

	            board density is becoming an important concern. In every aspect

	            of this research is the optimization of printed circuit board
	            manufacturing by improving the process productivity. Attention
	            was focused on reducing tool path length and processing time. The
	            paper is divided in two main parts. First part presents an
	            original hybrid heuristic algorithm, for solving traveling
	            salesman problem. The algorithm is based on the structure of a
	            general optimization procedure, and is used to reduce the tool
	            path length. Also, it is developed a practical mathematical model
	            for printed circuit board processing time calculation. The case
	            study on the second part of the paper shows basically the
	            efficient use of the above algorithm in finding the optimal
	            length of the tool path. It is shown the influence of stacked
	            printed circuit board on process productivity. By means of its
	            concepts management, the paper represent a real guide for optimal

	abstract = {With the increasing use of geometry scanners to create 3D models
	            , there is a rising need for fast and robust mesh smoothing to
	            remove inevitable noise in the measurements. While most previous
	            work has favored diffusion-based iterative techniques for
	            feature-preserving smoothing, we propose a radically different
	            approach, based on robust statistics and local first-order
	            predictors of the surface. The robustness of our local estimates
	            allows us to derive a non-iterative feature-preserving filtering
	            technique applicable to arbitrary "triangle soups". We
	            demonstrate its simplicity of implementation and its efficiency,
	            which make it an excellent solution for smoothing large, noisy,
	            and non-manifold meshes.},
