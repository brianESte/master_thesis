	            Such a system has to process a large number of on-line queries

	abstract = {A* is a search algorithm that has long been used in the
	            pathfinding research community. Its efficiency, simplicity, and
	            modularity are often highlighted as its strengths compared to
	            other tools. Due to its ubiquity and widespread usage, A* has
	            become a common option for researchers attempting to solve
	            pathfinding problems. However, the sheer amount of research done
	            on the topic makes it difficult to know where to start looking.
	            With this paper, we hope to create an accessible, up to date
	            reference on the current state of the A* search algorithm for
	            future pathfinding projects to consider. This paper examines
	            A-Star’s current usage in the field of pathfinding, comparing A*
	            to other search algorithms. It also analyzes potential future
	            developments for A-Star’s development. A* cannot keep up with the
	            demands of current pathfinding problems. Other algorithms can
	            maintain the same performance while also demanding less overhead
	            and this problem only grows worse as grid size increases. However
	            , use of innovative modifications such as different heuristic
	            types or secondary components to the algorithm allow A* to
	            achieve very fast times with good accuracy when dealing with
	            large maps, while only having slightly increased overhead costs
	            for the modifications. While beginning to show its age, improved
	            algorithms based on the classic A* algorithm are more than
	            capable of keeping up with modern pathfinding demands. These
	            derivative search algorithms such as HPA* is used to overcome the
	            limitations of A*. HPA* can compete with and even surpass its
	            competitors depending on the challenge faced.},

	abstract = {Abstract Field operations should be done in a manner that
	            minimizes time and travels over the field surface and is
	            coordinated with topographic land features. Automated path
	            planning can help to find the best coverage path so that the
	            field operation costs can be minimized. Intelligent algorithms
	            are desired for both two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional
	            (3D) terrain field coverage path planning. The algorithm of
	            generating an optimized full coverage pattern for a given 2D
	            planar field by using boustrophedon paths has been investigated
	            and reported before. However, a great proportion of farms have
	            rolling terrains, which have a considerable influence on the
	            design of coverage paths. Coverage path planning in 3D space has
	            a great potential to further optimize field operations. This work
	            addressed four critical tasks: terrain modeling and
	            representation, coverage cost analysis, terrain decomposition,
	            and the development of optimized path searching algorithm. The
	            developed algorithms and methods have been successfully
	            implemented and tested using 3D terrain maps of farm fields with
	            various topographic features. Each field was decomposed into
	            subregions based on its terrain features. A recommended “seed
	            curve” based on a customized cost function was searched for each
	            subregion, and parallel coverage paths were generated by
	            offsetting the found “seed curve” toward its two sides until the
	            whole region was completely covered. Compared with the 2D
	            planning results, the experimental results of 3D coverage path
	            planning showed its superiority in reducing both headland turning
	            cost and soil erosion cost. On the tested fields, on average the
	            3D planning algorithm saved 10.3\% on headland turning cost, 24.7
	            \% on soil erosion cost, 81.2\% on skipped area cost, and 22.0\%
	            on the weighted sum of these costs, where their corresponding
	            weights were 1, 1, and 0.5, respectively. © 2011 Wiley

	            used the K-means technique to obtain a primary segmented image.
	            We then employed a watershed technique that works on that image;
	            this process includes gradient of the segmented input image,
	            divides the image into markers, completes the watershed line by
	            using the markers, and stores the image in the format of region
	            adjacency graph (RAG). The initial segmentation result was
	            obtained by the watershed algorithm. We then used merging
	            techniques based on mean gray values and two edge strengths (Ti,
	            T2) to obtain edge maps. In this article we solved the problem of
	            undesirable oversegmentation results produced by the watershed
	            algorithm, when used directly with raw data images. Also, the
	            edge maps have no broken lines on the entire image, and the final
	            edge detection result is one closed boundary per actual region in
	            the image. },

	ABSTRACT = {To cover an area of interest by an autonomous vehicle, such as
	            an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), planning a coverage path which
	            guides the unit to cover the area is an essential process.
	            However, coverage path planning is often problematic, especially
	            when the boundary of the area is complicated and the area
	            contains several obstacles. A common solution for this situation
	            is to decompose the area into disjoint convex sub-polygons and to
	            obtain coverage paths for each sub-polygon using a simple
	            back-and-forth pattern. Aligned with the solution approach, we
	            propose a new convex decomposition method which is simple and
	            applicable to any shape of target area. The proposed method is
	            designed based on the idea that, given an area of interest
	            represented as a polygon, a convex decomposition of the polygon
	            mainly occurs at the points where an interior angle between two
	            edges of the polygon is greater than 180 degrees. The performance
	            of the proposed method is demonstrated by comparison with
	            existing convex decomposition methods using illustrative
	            examples.},

	abstract = {With the increasing use of geometry scanners to create 3D models
	            , there is a rising need for fast and robust mesh smoothing to
	            remove inevitable noise in the measurements. While most previous
	            work has favored diffusion-based iterative techniques for
	            feature-preserving smoothing, we propose a radically different
	            approach, based on robust statistics and local first-order
	            predictors of the surface. The robustness of our local estimates
	            allows us to derive a non-iterative feature-preserving filtering
	            technique applicable to arbitrary "triangle soups". We
	            demonstrate its simplicity of implementation and its efficiency,
	            which make it an excellent solution for smoothing large, noisy,
	            and non-manifold meshes.},
