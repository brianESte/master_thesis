	abstract = {A* is a search algorithm that has long been used in the
	            pathfinding research community. Its efficiency, simplicity, and
	            modularity are often highlighted as its strengths compared to
	            other tools. Due to its ubiquity and widespread usage, A* has
	            become a common option for researchers attempting to solve
	            pathfinding problems. However, the sheer amount of research done
	            on the topic makes it difficult to know where to start looking.
	            With this paper, we hope to create an accessible, up to date
	            reference on the current state of the A* search algorithm for
	            future pathfinding projects to consider. This paper examines
	            A-Star’s current usage in the field of pathfinding, comparing A*
	            to other search algorithms. It also analyzes potential future
	            developments for A-Star’s development. A* cannot keep up with the
	            demands of current pathfinding problems. Other algorithms can
	            maintain the same performance while also demanding less overhead
	            and this problem only grows worse as grid size increases. However
	            , use of innovative modifications such as different heuristic
	            types or secondary components to the algorithm allow A* to
	            achieve very fast times with good accuracy when dealing with
	            large maps, while only having slightly increased overhead costs
	            for the modifications. While beginning to show its age, improved
	            algorithms based on the classic A* algorithm are more than
	            capable of keeping up with modern pathfinding demands. These
	            derivative search algorithms such as HPA* is used to overcome the
	            limitations of A*. HPA* can compete with and even surpass its
	            competitors depending on the challenge faced.},

	abstract = {Abstract Field operations should be done in a manner that
	            minimizes time and travels over the field surface and is
	            coordinated with topographic land features. Automated path
	            planning can help to find the best coverage path so that the
	            field operation costs can be minimized. Intelligent algorithms
	            are desired for both two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional
	            (3D) terrain field coverage path planning. The algorithm of
	            generating an optimized full coverage pattern for a given 2D
	            planar field by using boustrophedon paths has been investigated
	            and reported before. However, a great proportion of farms have
	            rolling terrains, which have a considerable influence on the
	            design of coverage paths. Coverage path planning in 3D space has
	            a great potential to further optimize field operations. This work
	            addressed four critical tasks: terrain modeling and
	            representation, coverage cost analysis, terrain decomposition,
	            and the development of optimized path searching algorithm. The
	            developed algorithms and methods have been successfully
	            implemented and tested using 3D terrain maps of farm fields with
	            various topographic features. Each field was decomposed into
	            subregions based on its terrain features. A recommended “seed
	            curve” based on a customized cost function was searched for each
	            subregion, and parallel coverage paths were generated by
	            offsetting the found “seed curve” toward its two sides until the
	            whole region was completely covered. Compared with the 2D
	            planning results, the experimental results of 3D coverage path
	            planning showed its superiority in reducing both headland turning
	            cost and soil erosion cost. On the tested fields, on average the
	            3D planning algorithm saved 10.3\% on headland turning cost, 24.7
	            \% on soil erosion cost, 81.2\% on skipped area cost, and 22.0\%
	            on the weighted sum of these costs, where their corresponding
	            weights were 1, 1, and 0.5, respectively. © 2011 Wiley

	            tedious and dangerous tasks. The use of robots bypasses the
	            hazards and potentially increases the efficiency of both tasks. A
	            first crucial step towards robotic mine/UXO clearance is to
	            locate all the targets. This requires a path planner that
	            generates a path to pass a detector over all points of a mine/UXO
	            field, i.e., a planner that is complete.The current state of the
	            art in path planning for mine/UXO clearance is to move a robot
	            randomly or use simple heuristics. These methods do not possess
	            completeness guarantees which are vital for locating all of the
	            mines/UXOs. Using such random approaches is akin to intentionally
	            using imperfect detectors. In this paper, we first overview our
	            prior complete coverage algorithm and compare it with randomized
	            approaches. In addition to the provable guarantees, we
	            demonstrate that complete coverage achieves coverage in shorter
	            time than random coverage. We also show that the use of complete
	            approaches enables the creation of a filter to reject bad sensor
	            readings, which is necessary for successful deployment of robots.
	            We propose a new approach to handle sensor uncertainty that uses
	            geometrical and topological features rather than sensor
	            uncertainty models. We have verified our results by performing
	            experiments in unstructured indoor environments. Finally, for
	            scenarios where some a priori information about a minefield is
	            available, we expedite the demining process by introducing a
	            probabilistic method so that a demining robot does not have to
	            perform exhaustive coverage. },

	ABSTRACT = {Coverage path planning consists of finding the route which
	            covers every point of a certain area of interest. In recent times
	            , Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have been employed in several
	            application domains involving terrain coverage, such as
	            surveillance, smart farming, photogrammetry, disaster management,
	            civil security, and wildfire tracking, among others. This paper
	            aims to explore and analyze the existing studies in the
	            literature related to the different approaches employed in
	            coverage path planning problems, especially those using UAVs. We
	            address simple geometric flight patterns and more complex
	            grid-based solutions considering full and partial information
	            about the area of interest. The surveyed coverage approaches are
	            classified according to a classical taxonomy, such as no
	            decomposition, exact cellular decomposition, and approximate
	            cellular decomposition. This review also contemplates different
	            shapes of the area of interest, such as rectangular, concave and
	            convex polygons. The performance metrics usually applied to
	            evaluate the success of the coverage missions are also presented.

	abstract = {The number of two-dimensional surveying missions with unmanned
	            aerial vehicles has dramatically increased in the last years. To
	            fully automatize the surveying missions it is essential to solve
	            the coverage path planning problem defined as the task of
	            computing a path for a robot so that all the points of a region
	            of interest will be observed. State-of-the-art planners define as
	            the optimal path the one with the minimum number of flight lines.
	            However, the connection path, composed by the path from the
	            starting point to the region of interest plus the path from it to
	            the ending point, is underestimated. We propose an efficient
	            planner for computing the optimal edge-vertex back-and-forth
	            path. Unlike previous approaches, we take into account the
	            starting and ending points. In this article, we demonstrate the
	            vertex-edge path optimality along with in-field experiments using
	            a multirotor vehicle validating the applicability of the planner.

	abstract = {The pandemic by COVID-19 is causing a devastating effect on the
	            health of the global population. Currently, there are several
	            efforts to prevent the spread of the virus. Among those efforts,
	            cleaning and disinfecting public areas have become important
	            tasks and they should be automated in future smart cities. To
	            contribute in this direction, this paper proposes a coverage path
	            planning method for a spraying drone, an unmanned aerial vehicle
	            that has mounted a sprayer/sprinkler system, that can disinfect
	            areas. State-of-the-art planners consider a camera instead of a
	            sprinkler, in consequence, the expected coverage will differ in
	            running time because the liquid dispersion is different from a
	            camera’s projection model. In addition, current planners assume
	            that the vehicles can fly outside the target region; this
	            assumption can not be satisfied in our problem, because
	            disinfections are performed at low altitudes. Our method presents
	            i) a new sprayer/sprinkler model that fits a more realistic
	            coverage volume to the drop dispersion and ii) a planning method
	            that efficiently restricts the flight to the region of interest
	            avoiding potential collisions in bounded scenes. The algorithm
	            has been tested in several simulation scenes, showing that it is
	            effective and covers more areas with respect to two approaches in
	            the literature. Note that the proposal is not limited to
	            disinfection applications, but can be applied to other ones, such
	            as painting or precision agriculture.},

	            Differential Evolution variants with Linear population size
	            reduction(L-SHADE) is presented to solve this problem. The method
	            comprises two parts: the part of sub area coverage path planning
	            and the part of finding the optimized sequence of sub area start
	            points. The key idea is establishing the relationship between the
	            starting point of each sub area and the optimized multi-area
	            path. We implement the method through numbering the possible
	            starting point of sub area path and proposing a computing
	            formula. In addition, the results of L-SHADE mutation process are
	            optimized which make L-SHADE possible to apply in multi-area
	            coverage path planning. This method avoids area discretization
	            and exponential growth of computational quantities, and it is
	            suitable for complex areas as well as multi-area. The simulation
	            results with MATLAB showed the improvement of coverage path
	            planning task execution efficiency. Compared with the method
	            thinking of the sub area as the center of it, our method reduced
	            the multi-area coverage path length by 4%–7%. From the
	            simulations and analysis, we concluded that the method is able to

	            waypoints required for guidance, navigation and control of
	            agricultural robots and autonomous tractors throughout the
	            execution of these field operations. Typical field operations are
	            repetitively required nearly every cropping season and therefore
	            it should be carried out in a manner that maximizes the yield and
	            minimizes operational cost, time and environmental impact taking
	            into account the topographic land features. Current 3D terrain
	            field coverage path planning algorithms are simply 2D coverage
	            path planning projected into 3D through field terrain represented
	            by the field’s Digital Elevation Model (DEM). When projecting 2D
	            coverage plan into its 3D counterpart, the actual distance
	            between adjacent paths on the topographic surface either
	            increases or decreases, and consequently there might be skips or
	            overlaps between adjacent paths on the slopes. In addition, when
	            the machine rolls on slopes the effective width of the implement
	            decreases by a similar amount to double this error and
	            complicates the problem. Skips and overlaps can lead to an
	            inefficient use of land and resources. In this paper, a numerical
	            approach to estimate the total skip/overlap areas is developed
	            and applied to determine the optimum-driving angle that minimizes
	            this impact. Also, a novel side-to-side 3D coverage path planning
	            approach, which ensures zero skips/overlaps regardless of the
	            topographical nature of the field terrain, is developed. The
	            approaches developed in this paper are tested and validated using
	            a hypothetical test field of a tailored terrain and a real
	            experimental field of uneven terrain nature. The proposed
	            approaches illustrated that a significant percentage of uncovered
	            area could be saved if appropriate driving angle is chosen and if
	            a side-to-side 3D coverage is used.},

	            normal vectors and curvatures on arbitrary triangle meshes. We
	            present a consistent derivation of these first and second order
	            differential properties using averaging Voronoi cells and the
	            mixed Finite-Element/Finite-Volume method, and compare them to
	            existing formulations. Building upon previous work in discrete
	            geometry, these operators are closely related to the continuous
	            case, guaranteeing an appropriate extension from the continuous
	            to the discrete setting: they respect most intrinsic properties
	            of the continuous differential operators. We show that these
	            estimates are optimal in accuracy under mild smoothness
	            conditions, and demonstrate their numerical quality. We also
	            present applications of these operators, such as mesh smoothing,
	            enhancement, and quality checking, and show results of denoising
	            in higher dimensions, such as for tensor images.},

	abstract = { K-means and watershed segmentation techniques are presented to
	            perform image segmentation and edge detection tasks. We first
	            used the K-means technique to obtain a primary segmented image.
	            We then employed a watershed technique that works on that image;
	            this process includes gradient of the segmented input image,
	            divides the image into markers, completes the watershed line by
	            using the markers, and stores the image in the format of region
	            adjacency graph (RAG). The initial segmentation result was
	            obtained by the watershed algorithm. We then used merging
	            techniques based on mean gray values and two edge strengths (Ti,
	            T2) to obtain edge maps. In this article we solved the problem of
	            undesirable oversegmentation results produced by the watershed
	            algorithm, when used directly with raw data images. Also, the
	            edge maps have no broken lines on the entire image, and the final
	            edge detection result is one closed boundary per actual region in
	            the image. },

	ABSTRACT = {To cover an area of interest by an autonomous vehicle, such as
	            an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), planning a coverage path which
	            guides the unit to cover the area is an essential process.
	            However, coverage path planning is often problematic, especially
	            when the boundary of the area is complicated and the area
	            contains several obstacles. A common solution for this situation
	            is to decompose the area into disjoint convex sub-polygons and to
	            obtain coverage paths for each sub-polygon using a simple
	            back-and-forth pattern. Aligned with the solution approach, we
	            propose a new convex decomposition method which is simple and
	            applicable to any shape of target area. The proposed method is
	            designed based on the idea that, given an area of interest
	            represented as a polygon, a convex decomposition of the polygon
	            mainly occurs at the points where an interior angle between two
	            edges of the polygon is greater than 180 degrees. The performance
	            of the proposed method is demonstrated by comparison with
	            existing convex decomposition methods using illustrative
	            examples.},
