	ABSTRACT = {To cover an area of interest by an autonomous vehicle, such as an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), planning a coverage path which guides the unit to cover the area is an essential process. However, coverage path planning is often problematic, especially when the boundary of the area is complicated and the area contains several obstacles. A common solution for this situation is to decompose the area into disjoint convex sub-polygons and to obtain coverage paths for each sub-polygon using a simple back-and-forth pattern. Aligned with the solution approach, we propose a new convex decomposition method which is simple and applicable to any shape of target area. The proposed method is designed based on the idea that, given an area of interest represented as a polygon, a convex decomposition of the polygon mainly occurs at the points where an interior angle between two edges of the polygon is greater than 180 degrees. The performance of the proposed method is demonstrated by comparison with existing convex decomposition methods using illustrative examples.},

	abstract={This paper proposes a unified and consistent set of flexible tools to approximate important geometric attributes, including normal vectors and curvatures on arbitrary triangle meshes. We present a consistent derivation of these first and second order differential properties using averaging Voronoi cells and the mixed Finite-Element/Finite-Volume method, and compare them to existing formulations. Building upon previous work in discrete geometry, these operators are closely related to the continuous case, guaranteeing an appropriate extension from the continuous to the discrete setting: they respect most intrinsic properties of the continuous differential operators. We show that these estimates are optimal in accuracy under mild smoothness conditions, and demonstrate their numerical quality. We also present applications of these operators, such as mesh smoothing, enhancement, and quality checking, and show results of denoising in higher dimensions, such as for tensor images.},
