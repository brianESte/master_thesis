\chapter{Conclusion}

Will fill this in later.
Current conclusion(s):
\begin{enumerate}
	\item I did not do sufficient research in the beginning, leading to wasted efforts later on
	\item My workflow was short-sighted, in that i only thought / considered a few steps ahead of my current position,
		rather than having a solid "big picture" view
	\item For simple flat objects with sharp edges, it works fine
	\item ...
\end{enumerate}

\section{Outlook}
Further work would include:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Modified Traveling Salesman Problem
	\item Inverse kinematics that better take into account the rotary table
	\item Reachability was basically ignored in this project, so that should be explored...	
\end{itemize}
